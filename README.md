QuickMaps is a Chrome extension that lets you check travel time, distance, and get directions

It also saves your recent searches and trips for quick access.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
QuickMaps uses a Cloudflare Worker proxy to securely send your requests to Google Maps APIs.  
This keeps your API key private and prevents it from being exposed in the extension source code.
